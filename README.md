Use ComputerCraft turtles to quickstart your modded playthrough


# Disclaimer
**This project is a work in progress, it might never reach a functional state!**
I am creating a repo to motivate myself to make meaningful progress and work on this in a more structured way.


# What is this?
As a frequent modded minecraft player I got really bored of doing the exact same thing over and over again at the start of my every playthrough. Having to waste the first few hours of my playthrough, trying to get some basic automated source of resources gets boring eventually. If I wanted to mine for ores and chop wood, I would be playing vanilla!

To avoid this, I aim to create a turtle program that requires minimal setup and gets the player past the early game with *reasonable* efficiency.

# Starting requirements

Before you start your turtle program, you need to make sure these conditions are met

**These might be changed later as I learn more about CC turtles**
- Turtle is standing on the center of a flat, at least 7x7 square, made of either grass or dirt blocks.
- There are a few oak trees/saplings on this square
- Turtle has a pickaxe

# End goal

This is also just plans so far, I want the turtle to create a tree farm on the flat surface with a small storage room below it. Also it should get the resources to create a second turtle which then starts mining ores and getting them to storage. Obviously these turtles shouldn't run out of fuel and should be able to keep working even after repeated server restarts/chunk unloads.

# Installation
Soonâ„¢ (This section requires some actual code to be written...)
